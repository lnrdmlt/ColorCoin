# ColorCoin

This project was developed in order to test to see what unique characteristics give a high value. 

# ColorCoin ROADMAP

## MVP 
- There are 100 NFTs minted. 
- The creator of ColorCoin, me, mints the NFTs.
- We distribute ColorCoin to known Wallet Address, but then keep the remainding within the contract creator's wallet. 
- Each coin will have a colored thumbnail image. 
- We will use ERC 721. 
- The "uniqueness" of each NFT is the color of the coin. 
- The NFT changes everytime it is traded. We will use a HSL color model, either adding 10 to the hue. 
- Each Token will have a name, number, color.
    
## NICE TO HAVE

- We will produce a 3D model. 
- We will also track the number of times that the token has been traded. 
- POTENTIALLY mix NFTS to change colors. 
- Create a locking mechanism so that when a rare color does happen, someone can buy without changing the color. 
- Create an unlocking mechanism to counteract.
